To run the code you just need to change local directory to the Matlab 
included in this solution.

To run Kmean
just run the script_KMEAN.m , and it will simply ask you to select the
dataset file,r (number of iteration select 2 for simplicity), and k (number of classes).
 
To run EM
Run the script_EM.m KMEAN, and it will simply ask you to select
the dataset, initialization strategy (random/kmeans), r, and k.

All plots in the report along with numeric results will pop up for you...
